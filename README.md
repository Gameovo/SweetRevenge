SweetRevenge

 - Sweet Revenge is an addon that tries to reuse the WoW Blizzard UI for advanced combat (notice that this is the initial version... so, don't expect too much).

 - This is essencially for my personal use (it has bugs some bugs, but is possible to play with some care...), but I share with you because you may want to help giving me clues about how I can s solve the issues. 

 - At this moment, you need to have all the WoW Action bars activated before loading the addon.
 - This addon change some CVARS. I recommend that you do a backup of your WTF folder before testing.
 - I used the WoW resolution of 1920x1080 for Sweet Revenge addon development.
